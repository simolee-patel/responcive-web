        <p>
          Photography is the art, application and practice of creating durable
          images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either
          electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of
          a light-sensitive material such as photographic film.
        </p>
        <p>
          a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects
          into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera
          during a timed exposure. With an electronic image sensor, this
          produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically
          processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or
          processing.
